  - Manages client connections.
  - Forwards messages between clients.
  - Allows private communication between users.

- **Client:**
  - User-friendly graphical interface.
  - Sending messages to all participants.
  - Sending private messages to specific users.

## Requirements

- **Server and Client:**
  - Python 3.x

- **Client:**
  - `customtkinter` library (installable via `pip install customtkinter`)

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luis-ota/pyChat.git
   ```

2. **Server Configuration:**
   - In `servidor.py`, specify the IP of the machine that will be the server.
   - Disable the server firewall to allow connections.

3. **Client Configuration:**
   - Put the server's IP in the client's code.

4. **Start the Server:**
   - Execute the `servidor.py` script.

5. **Start the Clients:**
